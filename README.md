# Abstract
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the impact of public health interventions on epidemic spread has become crucial for managing future outbreaks. A common framework for pandemic modelling is the SIR (Susceptible/Infected/Recovered) model which uses differential equations to model disease spread. There are many extensions of this model that add more groups (such as SIVQR -- Susceptible/Infected/Vaccinated/Quarantined/Recovered), and there are innumerable different policy interventions/characteristics of the disease one can consider in the model. This report aims to determine which policy measures are most important in managing disease spread.
